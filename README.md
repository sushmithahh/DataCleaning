# Task 1 – Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

This repository contains my solution for *Task 1: Data Analyst Internship Assignment*.  
I worked on this task using *Python (Pandas) in VS Code* to clean and preprocess a raw dataset.

## Steps Performed
- Loaded the dataset in Python using Pandas.
- Identified and handled missing values (isnull(), dropna(), fillna()).
- Removed duplicate records (drop_duplicates()).
- Standardized text values (e.g., gender, country names).
- Converted date columns into a consistent format (dd-mm-yyyy).
- Renamed columns for clean and uniform naming.
- Checked and corrected data types (e.g., age as int, date as datetime).

## Deliverables
- cleaned_dataset.csv → Final cleaned dataset.
- task1_cleaning.py or task1_cleaning.ipynb → Code file with cleaning steps.
- README.md → Explanation of the process.

## Tools Used
- *Python* (Pandas, NumPy)
- *VS Code* (for coding and execution)
